Linear Regression to Predict Profits

Overview:
This Python program utilizes linear regression to predict profits based on city populations. It loads data from a provided text file, visualizes this data on a scatter plot, and then applies linear regression to model the relationship between city population and profit. The model's predictions are visualized with a regression line plotted over the original data points. Additionally, the program forecasts profits for populations of 35,000 and 70,000.

Features:
Data loading and visualization
Linear regression model training
Visualization of the regression model
Profit predictions for specified population sizes

Requirements:
Python 3.x
NumPy (for mathematical computations)
Matplotlib (for plotting graphs)

Usage:
Place the data.txt file in the same directory as the linear_regression.py script.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the script with the command:
"python linear_regression.py"
The script will display two plots: one showing the data points and another showing the same data points with a regression line representing the trained linear regression model.
After the plots, predictions for populations of 35,000 and 70,000 (scaled appropriately) will be printed in the terminal, showing the expected profit for a food truck in cities of these sizes.
